Contact Admin/Report Player [contact]
=====================================

This is a fairly simple mod that allows users of your server to easily send you a message whether you are online or not. If a player is suspected to be cheating or doing some other forbidden activity, other players can "file" reports. When viewing reports, they are grouped by player. When viewing general messages, they are also grouped by player, but by the players sending them. Conversations between the admin are like emails, the player can look for your response and reply to it.

An admin/moderator can be assigned to each case, as all with the `contact` privilege have access to the main dashboard. Conversations and cases can also be locked, so that a second admin cannot participate in the conversation and/or cannot view it.

**Note:** banning or kicking players automatically is not planned at the time, and likely will not be implemented unless many people are interested in the feature.
